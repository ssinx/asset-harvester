NVIDIA Asset Harvester is a generative AI model that extracts 3D Gaussian object representations directly from captured driving scenes, even from partial or obstructed views, removing manual asset creation. Each extracted asset feeds into Harmonizer for scene integration, enabling scalable data generation for autonomous vehicle simulation.


### Abstract

Closed-loop simulation is a core component of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling scalable testing, training, and safety validation before real-world deployment. Neural scene reconstruction converts driving logs into interactive 3D environments for simulation, but it does not produce complete 3D object assets required for agent manipulation and large-viewpoint novel-view synthesis.
To address this challenge, we present Asset Harvester, an image-to-3D model and end-to-end pipeline that converts sparse, in-the-wild object observations from real driving logs into complete, simulation-ready assets.
Rather than relying on a single model component, we developed a system-level design for real-world AV data that combines large-scale curation of object-centric training tuples, geometry-aware preprocessing across heterogeneous sensors, and a robust training recipe that couples sparse-view-conditioned multiview generation with 3D Gaussian lifting. Within this system, SparseViewDiT is explicitly designed to address limited-angle views and other real-world data challenges.
Together with hybrid data curation, augmentation, and self-distillation, this system enables scalable conversion of sparse AV object observations into reusable 3D assets.

**Asset Harvester** turns real-world driving logs into complete, simulation-ready 3D assets — from just one or a few in-the-wild object views. It handles vehicles, pedestrians, riders, and other road objects, even under heavy occlusion, noisy calibration, and extreme viewpoint bias. A multiview diffusion model generates consistent novel viewpoints, and a feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor lifts them to full 3D in seconds. The result: high-fidelity 3D Gaussian splat assets ready for insertion into simulation environments. The pipeline plugs directly into NVIDIA NCore and NuRec for scalable data ingestion and closed-loop simulation.

## Pipeline Overview

NCore V4 Data ─► NCore Parsing ─► Multiview Diffusion + Gaussian Lifting ─► [`metadata.yaml`](docs/end_to_end_example.md#step-3-generate-external-assets-metadata-to-use-with-nvidia-omniverse-nurec-optional) (required for NuRec Object Insertion)

<details>
<summary><b>Setup</b></summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **conda** (Miniconda or Miniforge)
- **NVIDIA driver** >= 570 (CUDA 12.8 compatible)
- **GCC** 10–13 (tested with GCC 12.3)
- **GPU VRAM** ~16 GB (add `--offload_model_to_cpu` to offload unused models to CPU for lower VRAM)

> **Note:** Initial setup takes ~20 minutes to complete.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/asset-harvester.git
cd asset-harvester
bash setup.sh
conda activate asset-harvester
```

> **Option note:**  `bash setup.sh --env-name asset-harvester --python 3.10`

The bash script `setup.sh` handles the full environment setup for this repo.

If you need a manual install from a checkout, preinstall the pinned `gsplat` build first, then install the repo with the extras you need:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation \
    "git+https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat.git@b60e917c95afc449c5be33a634f1f457e116ff5e"
pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 \
    -e ".[ncore-parser,multiview_diffusion,tokengs,camera-estimator]"
```

#### Download Model Checkpoints

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
hf auth login
hf download nvidia/asset-harvester --local-dir checkpoints
```
or, manually from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/asset-harvester).
This places the following files in `checkpoints/`:

```
checkpoints/
├── AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
├── AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
├── AH_camera_estimator.safetensors
└── AH_object_seg_jit.pt
```

<summary><b>Image-to-3D</b></summary>

Try Asset Harvester on our sample data (Multiview Diffusion + Gaussian Lifting).
Requires ~16GB VRAM. If you run into VRAM OOM issues, add `--offload_model_to_cpu` to offload unused model components to CPU:

```bash
export DATA_ROOT=data_samples/rectified_AV_objects/
export CHECKPOINT_MV=checkpoints/AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_GS=checkpoints/AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
export OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/harvesting
python3 run_inference.py \
    --diffusion_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_MV}" \
    --data_root "${DATA_ROOT}" \
    --output_dir "${OUTPUT_DIR}" \
    --lifting_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_GS}"
```

Or if you have a single-view image with an object in the center and a foreground mask, resize them into 512x512, and place them in a folder with this structure:

```
YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT/
├─── YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_0
│    ├── frame.jpeg
│    └── mask.png
└─── YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_1
...
```

If masks are not available, you can also use our image segmentation model to
 get mask.png from frame.jpeg stored in above structure:

```bash
export CHECKPOINT_SEG=checkpoints/AH_object_seg_jit.pt
export IMAGE_ROOT=data_samples/segmented_images 
python -m asset_harvester.utils.image_segment \
  --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT_SEG \
  --image_folder $IMAGE_ROOT \
  --frame_name frame.jpeg \
  --mask_name mask.png
```

Check the folder `data_samples/OOD_images` for example.

After data preparation, run Asset Harvester with our built-in camera estimator:

```bash
export YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT=data_samples/OOD_images
export CHECKPOINT_MV=checkpoints/AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_GS=checkpoints/AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_CAM=checkpoints/AH_camera_estimator.safetensors
export OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/harvesting_with_camera_estimate
python3 run_inference.py \
    --diffusion_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_MV}" \
    --ahc_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_CAM}" \
    --image_dir "${YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT}" \
    --output_dir "${OUTPUT_DIR}" \
    --lifting_checkpoint  "${CHECKPOINT_GS}"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Post-Training (Fine-Tuning)</b></summary>

The SparseViewDiT multiview diffusion model can be fine-tuned on your own parsed samples with the same rectified-flow objective it was pretrained with, built on HuggingFace `diffusers` + `accelerate` (full fine-tuning or LoRA, single- or multi-GPU). See the **[Post-Training Guide](docs/post_training.md)**.

<a id="benchmark"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Benchmark</b></summary>

Evaluate `run_inference.py` output by rendering Gaussian splat assets from reserved-view cameras and comparing to ground-truth frames. Computes **PSNR**, **LPIPS**, **SSIM**, and optional **DINOv3 embedding** distances.

#### Setup

Install benchmark evaluation dependencies and download third-party model weights required for evaluation. The script requires Hugging Face access to `facebook/dinov3-vith16plus-pretrain-lvd1689m` and `facebook/sam-3d-body-dinov3`.

Note that the benchmark environment needs `transformers>=4.56.0`, while the main asset-harvester environment uses `transformers==4.48.3`. Therefore, we clone the environment into a separate benchmark environment and install the updated dependencies.
```bash
conda create --name av-object-benchmark --clone asset-harvester

conda activate av-object-benchmark 
bash benchmark/install.sh
```

This installs benchmark-specific packages (`pytorch-lightning`, `yacs`, `ninja`, `termcolor`, `transformers>=4.56.0`), clones the SAM 3D Body repo, and downloads the SAM 3D Body and DINOv3 checkpoints. If the third-party checkpoints are unavailable (gated repo), eval still runs but skips embedding metrics.

#### Usage

```bash
python benchmark/eval.py --output_dir /path/to/run_inference_output --eval_output_dir benchmark/eval
```

See [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md) for the full list of options, input/output format, and metric descriptions.
